# Decentralized Voting System

## 📝 Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based smart contract that allows secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. It enables an admin to add candidates and start an election, while voters can cast one vote each. The results are publicly viewable and immutable once submitted.

## ✨ Key Features
- Admin-restricted control over election flow
- One-time voting validation via mapping
- Candidate management before election starts
- Public visibility of results

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integrate user wallet identity verification
- Implement events for front-end listening (e.g., vote cast)
- Create a visual DApp using React + Ethers.js
- Support for multiple elections
